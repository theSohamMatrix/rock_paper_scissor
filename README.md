# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors – Terminal Game in Python ✂️📄

A simple and fun **terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game** made using Python.  
You play against the computer, which picks randomly.  
It's a beginner-friendly project that helped me understand core programming concepts like **input handling**, **conditional logic**, and **randomization**.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the program in any Python-supported terminal.
2. Choose your move:  
   - `R` for Rock  
   - `P` for Paper  
   - `S` for Scissors  
3. The computer will randomly select its move.
4. The game will tell you if you **Win**, **Lose**, or it's a **Draw**.

## 🧠 What I Used / Learned

- `random.choice()` to make computer decisions
- `input()` to take user input
- `if-elif-else` for decision making
- Dictionaries to map user/computer choices to actual strings
- String formatting and terminal UI with `center()` and `print("=" * 50)`
